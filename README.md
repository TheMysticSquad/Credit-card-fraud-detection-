# Credit-card-fraud-detection-
A Credit Card Fraud Detection Project is a machine learning initiative focused on identifying fraudulent transactions within a large volume of credit card transactions. The objective is to develop a predictive model using historical transaction data to minimize false alarms and accurately detect all fraudulent transactions.

Key Points:
Objective: The primary goal is to prevent customers from being charged for unauthorized purchases by recognizing fraudulent credit card transactions.
Challenges:
- Enormous Data: Processing large volumes of data daily requires a fast model response to detect scams in a timely manner.
- Imbalanced Data: The rarity of fraudulent transactions (0.2%) poses challenges in accurately identifying them.
- Data Availability: The majority of the data used for detection is private.
- Misclassified Data: Not all fraudulent transactions are identified and reported.
- Adaptive Techniques: Scammers may utilize adaptive methods to evade detection.
